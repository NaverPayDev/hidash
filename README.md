# @naverpay/hidash

[![CI](https://github.com/NaverPayDev/hidash/actions/workflows/matrix.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NaverPayDev/hidash/actions/workflows/matrix.yaml)

A modern, performance-focused alternative to Lodash.

## Features

-   üöÄ **Dual Package Support (CJS, ESM)**: Built for modern JavaScript, optimized for tree-shaking
-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **High Performance**: Consistently faster than Lodash in benchmarks (verified with Vitest)
-   üîÑ **Drop-in Replacement**: 100% compatible with Lodash's interface and behavior
-   üéØ **Type Safety**: Written in TypeScript with complete type definitions
-   üì¶ **Subpath Imports**: Granular imports for minimal bundle size
-   üß™ **Test Coverage**: Every function has test cases that match Lodash's behavior exactly
-   0Ô∏è‚É£ **Zero Dependencies**: No external runtime dependencies, keeping your bundle lean
-   ‚úÖ **Proven Reliability**: Used in production at NAVER Pay

## Installation

```bash
npm install @naverpay/hidash
# or
yarn add @naverpay/hidash
# or
pnpm add @naverpay/hidash
```

## Usage

Import functions individually using subpath imports:

```typescript
import has from '@naverpay/hidash/has'
import isEmpty from '@naverpay/hidash/isEmpty'
import isObject from '@naverpay/hidash/isObject'

// Same interface as Lodash
has(object, 'user.name') // true
isEmpty([]) // true
isObject({}) // true
```

‚ùå Package does not support namespace imports:

```typescript
// This will not work
import {has, isEmpty} from '@naverpay/hidash'
```

## Why hidash?

-   **Modern**: Built specifically for subpath imports for optimal tree-shaking
-   **Performance**: Optimized implementations that outperform Lodash in most scenarios
-   **Compatibility**: Designed as a drop-in replacement with identical interfaces and behavior
-   **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite ensuring Lodash compatibility and performance benchmarks
